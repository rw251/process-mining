- make it just people with a history of GP bleed
- get all events following a bleed event
- label bleeds as recurrent bleed event
- split at NSAID start and then NSAID stop

- START->START (remove and investigate)
- Make DIED last event

bleeds - can't remember
bleeds2
	- filter to BLEED, GAST AND NSAID
	- BLEED AND NSAID mandatory
	- NSAID eventually follows BLEED
	> 113 patients had a bleed following GP stopped (median duration between 36 weeks / 113 = 8% of patients who stopped GP)
	> NSAID_STOPPED represent 76% of the events following NSAID_START at a median duration of 28 days - e.g. most NSAIDS are 1 month prescriptions or less without co-prescription of a GP
	> 42% of NSAID prescriptions and followed by another NSAID prescription with a median gap of 1 year
	> Median duration between NSAID_STOPPED and GP_STARTED = 13 months, and between GP_STOPPED and NSAID_STARTED = 47.5 weeks. No other significant pathways suggesting no link between NSAID prescription and GP prescription in 
	> YET 891 paths from NSAID_STOPPED to GP_STOPPED at a median gap of 19 days suggesting that any existing GP is stopped after NSAID removed
