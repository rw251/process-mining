    <h3 id="overview">1.1 Overview</h3>
    <p>One of the indicators in our SMASH dashboard looks for patients who are currently prescribed aspirin and at least one other antiplatelet, but who are not currently prescribed a gasto-protective (GP) medication. I picked this indicator because it has more events (3 start and 3 stop for each drug) than some of the other indicators. It also has multiple options - the pharmacist or GP can chose to stop an existing medication or start a new one.</p>
    <h3 id="method">1.2 Method</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I extracted all prescriptions for aspirin, other antiplatelets (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel), and gastro protective medication (H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors).</li>
      <li>Collapsed the prescriptions into STARTED and STOPPED events based on dose, instruction and packet size (e.g. if given 30 pills and the instruction of "take 2 daily" then we assume the drug is stopped 15 days after initiation unless a subsequent prescription is found in the record.) This uses methodology from my previous publication on this<sup>1</sup>.</li>
      <li>Load data into Disco</li>
      <li>Filtered to just those paths that start with "ASPIRIN-STARTED" or "ANTIPLATELET-STARTED" on the basis that patients who initiated a GP drug for a different reason aren't really following the same process</li>
      <li>We only have dates - the time always defaults to 4am. So to avoid concurrent events I have added 1 hour to every gasto-protection prescription as it makes sense to prescribe this after the antiplatelets. I then analysed the data twice: in <em>analysis A</em> I subtracted 1 hour from all aspirin prescriptions, and in <em>analysis B</em> I substracted 1 hour from all antiplatelet prescriptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following figures are just those cases that have both aspirin and another antiplatelet prescribed at any time as this more closely reflects the patients who appear in the dashboard.</p>

    <h3 id="thoughts-and-questions">1.4 Thoughts and questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Timeshift: I think I can justify why I shift GP meds back in time, but I'm less sure as to whether aspirin or antiplatelets should be prescribed first. I'm thinking of doing something akin to a sensitivity analysis whereby I repeat the analysis under different assumptions. <em><strong>Is this something that others have done with process mining - or if not does it sound a reasonable approach?</strong></em></li>
      <li>Figure 1
<ul><li>Lots of people are starting a GP after aspirin. These people probably have some other reason why they need gasto-protection e.g. they're also on Warfarin or have a history of internal bleeds / ulcers. In fact our medication dashboard has all of the following groups of patients who should have a GP:
<ul><li>Age &gt;65 + NSAID</li><li>Aspirin + Antiplatelet</li><li>History of bleeds + Antiplatelet (including aspirin)</li><li>History of bleeds + NSAID</li><li>Warfarin + Antiplatelet (including aspirin)</li></ul></li><li><em><strong>Perhaps I should look at a combined pathway including NSAID, antiplatelets, aspirin, warfarin and bleed history which might help find the interactions in patients with multiple morbidities?</strong></em></li></ul></li>
      <li>Manual editing of process map: These process maps have routes that don't terminate e.g. you get stuck in a loop and can't get to the "STOP" node. I guess this is ok and is just trying to prevent spaghetti, but <em><strong>is it possible within Disco (or a different tool) to say something like "only show the top 60% of paths but always include all paths from the START node and all paths to the END node"?</strong></em> Maybe for maps with not many nodes like this I should just include all paths.</li>
      <li>Minor annoyances:
<ul><li>Is there a way to save a project (currently I try to open a new one then save when it warns I have unsaved changes but there must be a better way)</li></ul></li>
