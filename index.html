    <ul>
      <li>Extracted all prescriptions for aspirin, other antiplatelets (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel), and gastro protective medication (H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors).</li>
      <li>Collapsed prescriptions into STARTED and STOPPED events based on dose, instruction and packet size (e.g. if given 30 pills and the instruction of "take 2 daily" then we assume the drug is stopped 15 days after initiation unless a subsequent prescription is found in the record.)</li>
      <li>Load data into Disco</li>
      <li>Filter to just those paths that start with "ASPIRIN-STARTED" or "ANTIPLATELET-STARTED" on the basis that patients who initiated a GP drug for a different reason aren't really following the same process</li>
      <li>We only have dates - the time always defaults to 4am. So to avoid concurrent events I have added 1 hour to every gasto-protection prescription as it makes sense to prescribe this after the antiplatelets. I then analysed the data twice: in <em>analysis A</em> I subtracted 1 hour from all aspirin prescriptions, and in <em>analysis B</em> I substracted 1 hour from all antiplatelet prescriptions.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Figure 1
<ul><li>Lots of people are starting a GP after aspirin. These people probably have some other reason why they need gasto-protection e.g. they're also on Warfarin or have a history of internal bleeds / ulcers. In fact our medication dashboard has all of the following groups of patients who should have a GP:
<ul><li>Age &gt;65 + NSAID</li><li>Aspirin + Antiplatelet</li><li>History of bleeds + Antiplatelet (including aspirin)</li><li>History of bleeds + NSAID</li><li>Warfarin + Antiplatelet (including aspirin)</li></ul></li><li><em><strong>Perhaps I should look at a combined pathway including NSAID, antiplatelets, aspirin, warfarin and bleed history which might help find the interactions in patients with multiple morbidities?</strong></em></li></ul></li>
      <li>Figure 2
<ul><li>I find it a bit annoying that there is a path from the start to the end that just includes ASPIRIN-STOPPED. If I set the path inclusion to 100% then this disappears as it isn't valid (it always comes after ASPIRIN-STARTED). <em><strong>Is there a way to deal with this situation?</strong></em></li></ul></li>
      <li>Figures x/y/z
<ul><li>These process maps have routes that don't terminate e.g. you get stuck in a loop and can't get to the "STOP" node. I guess this is ok and is just trying to prevent spaghetti, but <em><strong>is it possible within Disco (or a different tool) to say something like "only show the top 60% of paths but include all paths from the START node and to the END node"?</strong></em></li></ul></li>
